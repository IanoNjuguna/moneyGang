# Credit Scoring Demo

We showcase the use of American AI to build a behavioral credit scoring system using raw M-Pesa statements. 

## Project Overview

We demonstrate how financial how financial institutions assess a borrowerâ€™s creditworthiness using transactional behavior instead of traditional credit history. Using realistic M-Pesa-style statement data (in PDF or CSV), the pipeline includes:

- PDF parsing and normalization of transaction data
- Behavioral feature engineering (repayment patterns, volatility, etc.)
- Classification model training and evaluation (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- SHAP explainability for ethical AI
- A dashboard for user interaction

### Sample Data
This repository includes a realistic M-Pesa dataset (`mpesa_synthetic_dataset.csv`) for demonstration purposes only. It mimics the structure of real transaction data but contains no actual user or financial records.


## Setup Instructions

Set up a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```


Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Project. To parse an M-Pesa PDF statement:
- python parse_mpesa.py: This will extract transactions and output a cleaned CSV file (mpesa_dataset.csv.)

##### To train a model using simulated behavioral features:
- python train_model.py: The trained model is saved as credit_model.joblib.

##### To test explainability with SHAP:
- python shap_plot_demo.py: This will generate a SHAP image: SHAP_Interpretation.png.

##### To launch the dashboard:
- python credit_dashboard.py

### 5. Key Features
- Real-world simulation of M-Pesa behavior
- Explainable AI (XAI) via SHAP plots
- Ethical scoring through repayment patterns, not only income
- Custom credit algorithm built using domain-informed heuristics
- Simple GUI for real-time credit score display

### 6. Sample Output
- Model Accuracy: 92% (XGBoost)
- SHAP Factors: Repayments, inflow volume, transaction count
- Dashboard Output: Score + Eligibility tag
